Bookli is a book review web app in which a user can register, log in, search for books, review said books, read reviews of others, and log out.

## Files
API-key.csv => contains necessary credentials for the goodreads API

API-key.text => contains necessary credentials for the goodreads API

application.py => main flask application that routes everything

books.csv => list of books given by the course

import.py => python script importing the info from the book.csv file and the goodreads api into the database (Note: due to a misunderstanding of the necessary info from the goodreads api, there are additional lines to the script fixing the error made in the first place)
